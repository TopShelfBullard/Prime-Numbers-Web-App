##Prime Numbers Web App

Prime Numbers Web App is a Rails app that outputs the first 1000 prime numbers. It will eventually be a simple example example of configuring Rails to play happily with Ajax/JSON, bootstrap, and RSpec... or maybe it will grow into something cooler.

###Configurations:
* In the terminal, run:
git clone https://github.com/TopShelfBullard/Prime-Numbers-Web-App.git
cd Prime-Numbers-Web-App
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rails s

* fin
